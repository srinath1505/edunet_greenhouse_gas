# 📊 Supply Chain Emission Analysis – Week 1

This notebook contains exploratory data analysis and visualization on the *Supply Chain Emission Factors for U.S. Industries (2015)* dataset.

---

## ✅ Week 1 Tasks

- ✔️ Clean the data by removing null values in **Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins**
- ✔️ Remove duplicate rows
- ✔️ Create 10 meaningful visualizations for interpretation and insight

## 📈 Visualizations

### 1. Top 10 Industries by Total Emissions
- Horizontal bar chart showing the industries contributing the most to overall emissions.

### 2. Histogram of Emission Factor Distribution
- Overview of how emission factors are distributed across all records.

### 3. Boxplot of Emissions by Substance
- Identifies outliers and variance in emissions for each greenhouse gas.

### 4. Pie Chart of Total Emissions by Substance
- Shows the proportion of emissions contributed by CO₂, methane, N₂O, etc.

### 5. Violin Plot of Emission Distribution by Substance
- Combines distribution shape with median/variance.

### 6. Heatmap of Correlation Between Data Quality Indicators
- Helps identify possible biases or collinearity in DQ metrics.

### 7. Scatter Plot: Margins vs. Emission Factors
- Checks the relationship between emission factor margins and total impact.

### 8. Horizontal Bar Chart of Average Emissions by Industry
- Industry-wise comparison on a per-record basis.

### 9. KDE Plot of Emission Factor Density
- Smoothed density plot of emission distribution.
